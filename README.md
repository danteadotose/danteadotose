I am a genomics sciences undergraduate student with intermediate knowledge in bioinformatics, molecular biology, epigenetics and data science. I have experience developing machine and deep learning models for natural language processing, directed protein evolution and precision medicine. My interests are primarily behavioral neuroscience, computational linguistics, development and making science more accessible.

## Hi, I'm Dante :wave:

I'm a Genomic Sciences graduate interested in gene-environment interactions, behavioral neuroscience, psychiatric disorders, public health policies, and machine learning. My experience includes building AI-driven models for biomedical research, conducting population analyses, handling different types of data, from their raw form to insightful visualizations, and writing academic reports. I have good teamwork skills and I'm a self-thought person, always willing to learn new things.
